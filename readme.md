# Heuristics for AI Code Generation in Modern Editors

## Objective

This repository defines and documents heuristics and guidelines to guide code generation by Generative Artificial Intelligences (GAIs), especially in integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Windsurf and Cursor. The focus is to ensure that code suggested by GAIs is clean, secure, efficient, and aligned with the best software engineering practices.

It is part of a broader project that aims to promote the adoption of software engineering practices in AI-assisted development environments. This repository is the result of initial research and has focused on heuristics for the creation of agents and multi-agent systems using [crew.ai](https://www.crewai.com/), an intelligent agent development platform.

## Motivation

GAIs are already a reality and are part of our daily lives; programming is no exception. With proper care and critical curation, these tools offer productivity gains. However, there are also risks: insecure code, hard-to-maintain code, standards violations, and bad practices can spread on a large scale. This project aims to mitigate these risks by establishing clear and critical rules to guide the use of GAIs in these environments.

## Methodology

The construction of the heuristics and guidelines in this project followed a structured methodology, composed of:

- **Literature review:** Survey and critical analysis of technical literature, articles, academic publications, and reference materials on AI-assisted code generation and software engineering practices.
- **Selection of relevant sources:** Prioritization of recognized sources, necessarily including the official documentation of the tools and languages involved.
- **Organization of references:** Use of [Google Notebook LM](https://notebooklm.google/) as the central environment for study, recording, definitions, and refinement of heuristics. Notebook LM was fundamental for organizing ideas, synthesizing information, and facilitating access to sources during the project's development.
- **Definition of laboratory scope:** Creation of AI agents using a specific framework (crew.ai), following explicit recommendations from the official documentation and associating them with agent development heuristics.
- **Heuristic testing:** Implementation of AI agents to test and validate the proposed heuristics.

This approach ensures that the proposed heuristics are based on solid, up-to-date, and easily auditable knowledge.

## About the `rules.md` file

The [`rules.md`](./rules.md) file contains clear and practical guidelines for creating agents and multi-agent systems with CrewAI. The main points emphasize:

- **Modularity:** Agents and tasks as independent and reusable components.
- **Clarity:** Precise definition of agent roles, objectives, and context.
- **Collaboration:** Structuring teams (crews) for communication and task delegation.
- **Adaptability:** Mechanisms for dynamic task assignment and agent interaction.
- **Efficiency:** Resource optimization and scalability.
- **Communication strategies:** Choosing appropriate patterns according to complexity.
- **Iterative development:** Progressive construction, with testing and refinements.
- **Monitoring and logging:** Use of detailed logs and callbacks for tracking and debugging.

## Use Cases

The method for creating these heuristics was tested and validated in different practical contexts, including:

- Agent development projects using the crew.ai platform;
- Workflow automation projects with Apache Airflow;
- DevOps projects focused on creating and improving docker-compose.yaml files.

Applying the method—with specialized heuristics for each case—contributed to greater standardization, security, and efficiency in the generated code and automated processes.

## How to Use

1. **For generative AI developers:** Use the heuristics in [`rules.md`](rules.md) as a foundation for training, adjusting, or validating code generation models.
2. **For users of editors like Windsurf and Cursor:** Use the heuristics in [`rules.md`](rules.md) to create the respective .cursor and .windsurfrules files, adapting them to your project's requirements.
3. **For engineering teams:** Adopt the guidelines as a checklist for code reviews, continuous integration, and setting internal standards.

## Limitations

The heuristics proposed here do not replace critical human judgment. They should be seen as a starting point, to be continually reviewed and improved as new practices and challenges emerge in the generative AI and software development ecosystem.

No specific scientific articles on malicious code generated by AI have yet been analyzed. The focus of this work was productivity for quality coding, with the background being the development of agents and multi-agent systems with [crew.ai](https://www.crewai.com/).

No heuristics for software testing have been added yet; this is planned for future versions.

## Future Vision

The proposed heuristics are flexible and can be segmented according to project context. This allows, for example, the inclusion of practices and software testing techniques such as TDD (Test-Driven Development) or other relevant methods to further ensure the security and quality of code generated by AI.

Specific tests and examples of applying these techniques will be developed and published in due course, keeping up with the evolution of needs and tools in the AI-assisted development ecosystem.
